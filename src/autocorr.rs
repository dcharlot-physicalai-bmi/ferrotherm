//! Exact integrated autocorrelation times on enumerable models — the oracle `tau_int` never had.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Every effective sample size in this crate, every joules-per-independent-sample, every
//! [`crate::certify::Finding::Undermixed`], divides by [`crate::certify::tau_int`]: Sokal's
//! automatic windowing over an empirical autocorrelation, cut off at the first lag `W >= 5 tau(W)`.
//! Nothing had ever measured that estimator against a value that did not itself come from a trace.
//! When something did (`examples/tau_exactness.rs`, 2026-09-13), it found that on a 12-spin
//! frustrated grid at `beta = 1` the estimator reports **0.04 to 0.06 of the true autocorrelation
//! time at every trace length tried, up to 332,000 sweeps, with a 2% spread**. That is not a
//! short-trace bias. The chain's autocorrelation is a large fast mode plus a small slow one, so
//! `tau(W)` is still tiny when the window closes at lag 9, and the slow mode — most of the truth —
//! is never summed. No trace length repairs a window that has already closed.
//!
//! # What this computes
//!
//! On a model small enough to enumerate, a sampler's one-step kernel is an explicit linear
//! operator `P` on the `2^n` states, and the stationary autocovariance of any observable `f` at
//! lag `k` is exactly
//!
//! ```text
//!   C(k) = sum_x pi(x) e(x) (P^k e)(x),      e = f - <f>_pi,
//! ```
//!
//! so `tau_int = 1/2 + sum_{k >= 1} C(k) / C(0)`, summed until the tail is below floating point.
//! No sampling, no windowing, no trace. [`tau_int_exact`] does that for the kernels this crate
//! runs, applying `P` matrix-free so the `2^n x 2^n` operator is never stored.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! Two things. It is the reference every autocorrelation ESTIMATOR in this crate is scored
//! against — `tau_int` included — on the models where a reference exists. And it makes small-model
//! comparisons between samplers exact rather than estimated: a `tau` that carries no sampling error
//! and cannot be truncated, so a ratio of two of them is a fact about the two kernels.
//!
//! # State encoding
//!
//! State `x` in `0..2^n` has spin `i` equal to `+1` when bit `i` of `x` is set. `pi` is computed
//! here from [`crate::graph::Graph::energy`] and normalised, because the point of an oracle is that
//! it shares nothing with the sampler it checks except the model.

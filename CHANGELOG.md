## 0.2.0 (2026-08-05)

Wave 2 of the field ingest. Breaking: `Program::run` gains a trajectory-trace parameter.

- `het`: heterogeneous factor-graph Gibbs — spin and categorical nodes, energy-table factors of
  arbitrary arity (subsumes pairwise), proper-coloring block sweeps, clamping. Verified: a mixed
  spin+categorical model with a 3-ary factor matches exact Boltzmann enumeration (TV < 0.02); on
  pure-spin pairwise models the het and spin engines agree to 1e-12; clamped categorical
  conditionals match exact rows. The spin engine remains the fast path.
- `linalg`: cyclic Jacobi eigensolver for symmetric matrices (reconstruction-verified).
- `tla::solve_spd_exact_ou`: the bias-free exact Ornstein-Uhlenbeck transition integrator in the
  eigenbasis. New tests pin BOTH facts: the Euler-Maruyama chain's stationary covariance is
  biased per eigenmode by exactly 2/(2 - dt*alpha) (the test that catches silently absorbing it),
  and the exact integrator lands on beta^-1 alpha^-1 unbiased.
- `program::Gate::BoltzExact` + `Program::ebm_kernel_grad`: the third gradient estimator
  (EBM-kernel decomposition: one trajectory plus one auxiliary clamped draw, arXiv:2608.01612
  Sec III C). Cross-validated against exact-score REINFORCE and an in-test full-enumeration
  reference. Recorded along the way: finite differences with common random numbers is NOT a
  usable referee across a discrete re-draw (CRN decorrelates; noise floor exceeded the gradient),
  so the test enumerates instead.

## 0.1.0 (2026-08-05)

First public release. Pure Rust, zero dependencies, std-only, wasm-clean, deterministic by seed.

- `graph` + `gibbs`: sparse pairwise energy-based models, chromatic block-Gibbs with clamping.
  Verified: exact Boltzmann on enumerable systems; Onsager's 2D closed form to 4 decimals.
- `device`: the published degree-16 planar topology of Z1-class thermodynamic chips
  (displacement rules (1,0),(2,1),(2,3),(4,1); proven bipartite, longest edge sqrt(17)).
- `ledger`: first-class joules accounting; `Z1_SPICE` prices (pre-silicon vendor estimates,
  arXiv:2608.01615 Table IV) with the write/sample ratio (~21,700x) as a tested invariant.
- `tempering`: simulated annealing + parallel tempering with ladder diagnostics. Verified:
  finds exhaustively-enumerated ground states of frustrated glasses.
- `tla`: thermodynamic linear algebra (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck network; Aifer et al.,
  arXiv:2308.05660). Verified: SPD solves match Gaussian elimination; covariance estimates A^-1.
- `program`: stochastic differentiable circuits (flip, Gaussian-policy, linear-dynamics,
  stage-cost, Gibbs-kernel gates); REINFORCE, parameter-shift, and finite-difference gradients
  cross-validated; a trained stochastic controller reaches a provably optimal LQR gain.
- `compile`: variational compilation of conditional kernels onto device graph patches with
  hidden-unit marginalization; exact positive/negative-phase gradients (FD-verified to 1e-6);
  the chain-rule KL error bound verified exactly on compiled programs.
- `ffi`: C ABI (`ft_*`) for WebAssembly and host languages; FFI path re-verified against Onsager.
- Examples double as verification gates (exit codes); `web/gibbs_bench.html` is the WebGPU
  instrument (verifies against Onsager on the visitor's GPU before reporting throughput).
